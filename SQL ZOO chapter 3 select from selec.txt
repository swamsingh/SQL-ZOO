SQL ZOO chapter 3 select from select

1.
List each country name where the population is larger than 'Russia'.

solution
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

2.
Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

solution
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp/population >
    (SELECT gdp/population FROM world WHERE name = 'United Kingdom') AND continent = 'Europe'

3.
List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.


solution
SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia'))
ORDER BY name

4.
Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.


solution
SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population >
    (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Canada')
AND population <
    (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Poland')

5.
Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.

Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.


solution
SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'), 0), %)
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'

6.
Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)


solution
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp >= ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE gdp >=0 AND continent = 'Europe') AND continent != 'Europe'

7.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:


solution
SELECT continent, name, area
FROM world x
WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
    WHERE y.continent=x.continent
    AND area>0)

8.
List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.


solution
SELECT continent, name
FROM world x
WHERE name <= ALL(SELECT name FROM world y WHERE y.continent = x.continent)



9.
Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000.
Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.


solution
SELECT name, continent, population
FROM world x
WHERE 25000000  > ALL(SELECT population FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND y.population > 0)



10.
Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.


solution
SELECT name, continent
FROM world x
WHERE population > ALL(SELECT population*3 FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND population > 0 AND y.name != x.name)
